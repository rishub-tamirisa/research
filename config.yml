    description: "I am a 4th undergraduate researcher at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, working on AI alignment, interpretability, and multimodal representation learning. My current research focuses on developing techniques to probe and edit the knowledge in large models, aiming to improve transparency and control. I am also interested in representation learning that combines language with other modalities for open-ended downstream use. Across these areas, my work strives to advance the reliability, safety, and general intelligence capabilities of AI systems."

          subtitle: "I am a 4th-year undergraduate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I'm interested in research toward improving both AI capabilities and alignment, as well as multimodal learning and privacy-preserving machine learning. <br /><br /> 
          
          My current research focuses on developing robust safeguards in transformer LLMs, while ensuring benign/helpful capabilities can improve safely and reliably. I have also introduced novel state-of-the-art methods for personalized federated learning. My work has been accepted at ICML, CVPR, and ICLR, and featured in WIRED.<br /><br />
          
          I co-run a research organization called [<u>Lapis Labs</u>](https://lapis.rocks) (prev. AI@UIUC), and am also a founding engineer at a Sequoia-backed AI startup, [<u>Mindy Group</u>](https://mindy.com). I also previously worked at NASA."
